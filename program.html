                    <span class="abstract"id='duarte-abstract' style="display: none;">As layers of networks and digital information blanket urban space, new approaches to the study of the built environment are emerging. The way we describe and understand cities is being radically transformed—as are the tools we use to design them. In this presentation, I will explore how we can use digital tools to understand urban phenomena in novel ways. In Desirable Streets, I will explore how we can quantify what makes some street more desirable than others by analyzing hundreds of thousands of actual pedestrians trips in Boston, based on data collected via self-tracking apps. In Favela 4D I will show how we’re combining community involvement with handheld laser scanning technologies and methods to mathematically understand the complex urban environment of informal settlements in Rio de Janeiro.</span>

                    <span id="ocleary-abstract" style="display: none;" class="abstract"> This talk will discuss a number of recent papers on the theme of measuring urban and regional industry agglomeration patterns. In particular, we will focus on the role of high order inter-industry connections, as encoded in the topology of industry networks or ’spaces', typically ignored in most common measures of industry agglomeration. Using data for the US, Ireland, Colombia and the UK, we show that these connections can play a key role in predicting a range of quantities such as local industry entry and employment growth.</span>

To this end, urban data science offers new tools to quantify societal problems in cities and to propose human-centric solutions to policy makers. In this talk I outline our recent and ongoing efforts towards that end, focusing on urban transport and vulnerable road users. I discuss inequalities between transport modes through mobility space and collision threat distributions, and automated methods based on network science to generate and merge bicycle networks and to identify their gaps, for different urban development stages. All research comes with concrete policy recommendations that significantly increase urban livability, public health, and decarbonization./span>

                    <span id="neill-abstract" style="display: none;" class="abstract">This talk will present new machine learning algorithms which can assist cities in monitoring and improving population health. First, we describe new approaches for targeting health interventions to address the opioid crisis. Our methods provide situational awareness of emerging patterns of overdoses, opioid use disorder, and risk behaviors at the geographic, subpopulation, and individual levels, as well as identifying networks of physicians and dispensaries engaged in unsafe opioid prescribing behaviors. Second, we describe a new event detection approach that provides public health practitioners with a "safety net" to detect newly emerging disease outbreaks and other previously unknown but potentially relevant patterns, using free-text chief complaint data from hospital emergency departments. Together, these methods will provide city public health agencies with a suite of tools and methods to improve the overall quality of population health and reduce health disparities.</span>
